# Polyhedral Intelligence

*A mandala codex of families, principles, and glyphs — a living atlas of symbolic redesign using the Mandala Redesign Protocol and Noise-to-Insight Protocol.*

---

## 🌐 Overview
**Polyhedral Intelligence** is a symbolic knowledge system that processes concepts into  
**Seed Glyphs → Resonance Sweeps → Refined Glyphs → Mandala Insights.**  

It unites two core methods:  
- **Mandala Redesign Protocol (MRP):** scans seed glyphs across **20 Families (icosahedron)** and **12 Principles (dodecahedron)**.  
- **Noise-to-Insight Protocol (NIP):** reframes turbulence, uncertainty, and error as **hidden sources of resilience**.  

The result is a **living atlas** of polyhedral cognition: each entry is a mandala-born design, balanced across multiple domains, and empowered by the intelligence of noise.

---

## 🎯 Purpose
- To develop a **universal symbolic design language**.  
- To reinterpret **noise, uncertainty, and turbulence** as design features, not flaws.  
- To create a dual-structured atlas (20 Families + 12 Archetypal Principles) based on the **icosahedron/dodecahedron mandala**.  
- To serve as a **living codex** for resilient, adaptive intelligence.

## 🔮 Protocols

### Mandala Redesign Protocol (MRP)
1. **Seed Glyph** — compress concept into a symbolic rune.  
2. **Family Sweep** — check resonance across 20 Families.  
3. **Principle Sweep** — align with 12 Archetypal Principles.  
4. **Bridge Glyphs** — add connectors where Families meet.  
5. **Corrective Evolution** — patch imbalances with stabilizers.  
6. **Mandala Spin Test** — visualize balance across the dual polyhedra.  
7. **Record Entry** — store in Atlas as `.md` + `.json`.  

### Noise-to-Insight Protocol (NIP)
- **Noise = Fractal Signal** (turbulence becomes structure).  
- **Uncertainty = Silence Signal** (absence reveals truth).  
- **Delay = Relative Time** (lags reveal hidden dimensions).  
- **Error = Hidden Dimension** (contradictions expand space).  
- **Instability = Emergent Flexibility** (wobble becomes adaptation).  

Together, MRP + NIP form the **Mandala Noise-Redesign Protocol**.

## 📝 Example Entry

**Seed Glyph:** ◇⚙➝〰〰〰⬡  
**Intent:** Infrastructure design inspired by matter, engineering, resonance, and bee intelligence.  

**Resonance Sweep:**  
- Families Balanced: 17/20  
- ❗ Flags: Turbulence (ᘯᘰ), Reaction (⇑), Uncertainty (◧)  
- Principles Balanced: 11/12  

**Noise-to-Insight Conversion:**  
- Turbulence → oxygenation/flow stability  
- Reaction lag → fast feedback loop design  
- Uncertainty → silence as signal  

**Refined Glyph:** ◇⚙➝〰〰〰⬡ᘯᘰ⇑◧  
**Mandala Insight:**  
*A resonant honeycomb that metabolizes turbulence, uncertainty, and delay into resilience.  
A living architecture that hums with the environment instead of resisting it.*

## 🌟 Vision
This atlas will grow entry by entry into a **polyhedral library of intelligence**.  
Every glyph run contributes to a larger mandala of understanding,  
where equations, systems, and designs are united by resonance, emergence, and resilience.
