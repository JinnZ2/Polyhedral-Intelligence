  "insight": "A mycelial economy of family-based manufacturing nodes: resilient because it embraces turbulence, uncertainty, and fluctuation as sources of strength. Instead of uniform 'just-in-time' fragility, diversity and noise become stability. Like farming networks of the past, but upgraded with modern tools, this system is adaptive, ecological, and fundamentally human-centered."
