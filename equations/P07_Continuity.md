# P07. ⎯ Continuity Principle

**Domain:** Smoothness, unbroken flows, conservation across scales.

- **Continuity Equation**  
  ∂ρ/∂t + ∇·(ρv) = 0  
  → Glyph of Flow Persistence  

- **Calculus (Intermediate Value Theorem)**  
  Continuous functions cross values  
  → Glyph of Smooth Passage  

- **Topology Continuity**  
  ε–δ definition of continuity  
  → Glyph of Nearness  

- **Quantum Field Theory Continuity**  
  Gauge fields as continuous symmetries  
  → Glyph of Unbroken Fields
