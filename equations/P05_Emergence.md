# P05. ✦ Emergence Principle

**Domain:** Higher-order patterns, complexity, self-organization.

- **Cellular Automata (Conway’s Life)**  
  Simple rules → complex patterns  
  → Glyph of Spontaneous Order  

- **Phase Transitions**  
  Micro → Macro order  
  → Glyph of Critical Shift  

- **Complex Systems Scaling Laws**  
  P(k) ∝ k^(-γ)  
  → Glyph of Power Law Emergence  

- **Neural Networks**  
  Collective dynamics → learning  
  → Glyph of Collective Mind
