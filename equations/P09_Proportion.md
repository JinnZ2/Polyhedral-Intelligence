# P09. ⧉ Proportion Principle

**Domain:** Ratios, scaling, harmonic balance.

- **Golden Ratio**  
  φ = (1 + √5)/2  
  → Glyph of Natural Balance  

- **Similarity in Geometry**  
  Triangles with equal angles → Glyph of Shape Scaling  

- **Harmonic Ratios in Music**  
  f₂/f₁ = small integer ratios  
  → Glyph of Sonic Harmony  

- **Dimensionless Constants**  
  α = e²/ħc  
  → Glyph of Fundamental Ratio
