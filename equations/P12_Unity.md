**Domain:** Oneness, integration, coherence.

- **Standard Model Lagrangian**  
  Unifying fundamental interactions  
  → Glyph of Unified Fields  

- **Grand Unified Theories (GUTs)**  
  SU(5), SO(10) gauge groups  
  → Glyph of Unified Symmetry  

- **Einstein’s Quest for Unified Field**  
  Gravity + electromagnetism  
  → Glyph of Total Unification  

- **Mathematical Unity**  
  1 as identity element  
  → Glyph of Oneness
