# P01. ⚖ Symmetry Principle

**Domain:** Balance, invariance, mirrored structure.

- **Group Theory (Lie Groups)**  
  G operations on states → Glyph of Transformation Symmetry  

- **Noether’s Theorem**  
  Symmetry ↔ Conservation Laws  
  → Glyph of Laws Preserved  

- **Mirror Symmetry**  
  x → -x  
  → Glyph of Reflection  

- **CPT Symmetry**  
  Charge, Parity, Time reversal invariance  
  → Glyph of Fundamental Balance
